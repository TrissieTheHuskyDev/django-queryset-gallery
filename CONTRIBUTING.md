### How to contribute and create a issue

***

If you want to be a cool developer you can use template at the end of page. It helps you to create clear small task. Let's look on the main sections:

**Introduction** is a small description of a task. It's like an agenda.

**Problems** are problems of implementing a new functionality like database restriction or something else.

**Solution** is a solution of problems above

**Notes** are something important that you don't have to forget

**TODO** is TODO

An introduction and TODO sections are required. The other aren't.

***

The Template. Just copy and paste it like a code from stackoverflow.com

**Introduction**

**Problems**

**Solution**
